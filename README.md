# ESPHome EMC2305 Fan Controller Component

This is a custom ESPHome external component that adds support for the **EMC2305** 5-channel PWM fan controller over IÂ²C.

> ðŸ”§ **Based on the official [EMC2101](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/blob/dev/esphome/components/emc2101)** component in ESPHome, adapted and extended with help by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) for use with the EMC2305 IC.

## Features

- Control up to **5 independent PWM fan outputs** per EMC2305 chip
- Support for **RPM monitoring** for connected fans
- Support for **multiple EMC2305 devices** on the same IÂ²C bus
- Designed for full integration into **Home Assistant** via ESPHome
